# Coding-Library

This is a collection of implementations of various data structures and algorithms, intended for competitive programming. Some of these implementations are relatively old, as they are from my IOI times, but might still be a useful point of reference. 

The suggested way to set this up is to create a directory "coding_library" somewhere (or a symlink to this repo), and add it to $CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH. I plan on making a script that then expands the libraries that you use, but this is still a TODO.

Useful ideas, that aren't exactly a part of this library.
